'''
Python code written for the BeagleBone Black (BBB) to access and control
an ion electrospray thruster board. The board was not available at the 
time while writing the Python code.  As substitute, and Arduino was used 
to fake signals of the thruster board for hardware-in-the-loop testing.

The Python file was written using nano over ssh to the BBB.  The
indentation may be messed up in a few places.
